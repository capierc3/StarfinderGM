:::Laser Blast Trap - CR 1
Pit Trap - CR 1/2Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 411 XP 200 A 10-foot-square trapdoor opens when a creature walks on top of it, dumping victims into a 20-foot-deep pit. Pit TrapType analog; Perception DC 17; Disable Engineering DC 12 (open trap door) or DC 18 (jam trap door shut) Trigger location; Reset manual Effect 20-ft.-deep pit (2d6 falling damage); Reflex DC 11 avoids; multiple targets (all targets in a 10-ft.-square area) Laser Blast Trap - CR 1Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 412 XP 400 When sensors detect movement in the trapped room, a wall panel opens and a mounted laser rifle opens fire on the triggering creature. Laser Blast TrapType technological; Perception DC 21; Disable Engineering DC 15 (disable motion sensors) Trigger location; Reset 1 minute Effect laser +11 ranged (3d6+1 F) Jolting Console Trap - CR 3Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 412 XP 800 When an unsuspecting creature touches the trapped console, the console sparks with electricity, shocking the triggering creature. Jolting Console TrapType technological; Perception DC 24; Disable Engineering DC 19 (disable shock plates) Trigger touch; Reset immediate; Bypass wireless key card reader (Computers DC 19 to hack) Effect arc of electricity (6d6 E); Reflex DC 14 half Trash Compactor Trap - CR 5Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 412 XP 1,600 This trap consists of several 5-foot-square trapdoors that open when a creature stands on one, dumping the victim down a 60-foot-long chute and into a 30-foot-by-30-foot trash compactor with a single locked exit in one corner. The room is filled with debris and the floor functions as difficult terrain. One round later on the trap’s initiative count, two of the walls of the room begin closing inward, reducing the width of the room by 10 feet each round (to 20 feet on the first round, and so on). On the first round, this deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage to all nonamorphous creatures in the room. The damage increases to 8d6 on the second round, and to 32d6 on the third round. On the fourth round, the trash compactor’s exit opens to release the compressed garbage. A creature can climb back up the slippery chute with a successful DC 32 Athletics check. The gears controlling the compression mechanism have EAC 14, KAC 20, hardness 20, and 69 Hit Points. Trash Compactor TrapType technological; Perception DC 27; Disable Engineering DC 19 (disable compression for 1 round) or DC 25 (open exit door) Trigger location; Init +10; Duration 7 rounds; Reset 1 minute Initial Effect several 60-ft.-long chutes (3d6 falling damage); Reflex DC 18 avoids; multiple targets (any target in one of several 5-ft.-square areas); Secondary Effect crushing walls (30-ft.-square room compresses 10 ft. per round, 2d6 B on first round, 8d6 B on second round, and 32d6 B on third round); Reflex DC 15 half; never miss; onset delay (1 round); multiple targets (all nonamorphous targets in the room) Mind Spores Trap - CR 6Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 413 XP 2,400 When sensors detect movement, a vent releases a spray of spores that affect the triggering creature’s mental processes. Mind Spores TrapType hybrid; Perception DC 29; Disable Engineering DC 24 (jam vent closed) or Mysticism DC 24 (neutralize spores) Trigger location; Reset 1 hour Effect spores (–4 penalty to Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws for 1d4 hours; this is a mind-affecting effect); Will DC 16 negates; multiple targets (all targets in 30-ft. cone) Hacker's Curse Trap - CR 7Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 413 XP 3,200 When an unauthorized user attempts to hack the trapped computer console, a magical curse script downloads into nearby technological items, which become cursehacked. A creature using a cursehacked item takes a –4 penalty to attack rolls (if it’s a weapon), AC (if it’s a suit of armor), skill checks (if it’s involved in attempting the skill check), and so on. The virus replicates in other technological items if they touch either a cursehacked item or a creature carrying or wearing one. This curse remains until removed by remove affliction or similar magic or by a successful Computers DC 35 check that takes 10 minutes for a single item. Hacker's Curse TrapType hybrid; Perception DC 30; Disable Computers DC 25 (rewrite virus code) or Mysticism DC 25 (dispel curse) Trigger touch; Reset 1 minute Effect curse (technological items become cursehacked; this is a curse effect); Will DC 17 negates (items of 8th level or above only; lower-level items receive no save); multiple targets (tech items carried by all creatures within 60 ft. of console) Explosive Detonation Trap - CR 9Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 413 XP 6,400 When the trap detects a living creature within 5 feet, it explodes. Explosive Detonation TrapType technological; Perception DC 33; Disable Engineering DC 28 (defuse explosive) Trigger proximity (thermal, 5 feet); Reset none Effect explosion (8d12 F); Reflex DC 18 half; multiple targets (all targets within 20-ft. radius) Nanoflechette Launcher Trap - CR 11Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 413 XP 12,800 When sensors detect movement in the trapped room, the doors seal and five wall apertures open on its initiative count to launch nanoflechettes at everyone in the room. The trap fires nanoflechettes for 10 rounds, unless all the apertures have been closed or destroyed. An aperture has EAC 23, KAC 27, Fort +14, Ref +11, hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points. Closing or destroying one aperture reduces the damage dealt by 1d12. Nanoflechette Launcher TrapType technological; Perception DC 36; Disable Engineering DC 29 (close one aperture) or DC 35 (open door) Trigger location; Init +17; Duration 10 rounds; Reset 1 minute Effect nanoflechettes +25 ranged (6d12 P); multiple targets (all targets in room) Obedience Implant Trap - CR 12Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 413 XP 19,200 When the trap sees a creature within 10 feet, a lancet implants a magic microchip in the triggering creature, which falls under the telepathic control of the trap’s creator, as per dominate person (but affecting any creature). Removing the chip safely requires a 1-minute surgical procedure and a successful Medicine DC 28 check. Failure deals 3d6 slashing damage and leaves the implant in place. An implanted chip prevents magical means of ending the spell effect. Any later successful save (such as to resist a command) renders the spell effect dormant for 1 round rather than ending it. Obedience Implant TrapType hybrid; Perception DC 38; Disable Engineering DC 33 (disable lancet) or Mysticism DC 33 (render implant ineffective) Trigger proximity (visual, 10 feet); Reset manual Effect lancet +27 melee (3d6+10 P plus dominate person); Will DC 21 negates dominate person effect Disintegration Chamber Trap - CR 14Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 413 XP 38,400 When organic matter enters the trapped room, a disintegration beam permeates it 1 round later, atomizing everything within. Disintegration Chamber TrapType technological; Perception DC 41; Disable Engineering DC 36 (disable beam) Trigger location; Reset 1 minute Effect disintegration beam (14d12); Fortitude DC 22 reduces damage to 4d12; onset delay (1 round); multiple targets (all targets in room) Soul Upload Trap - CR 17Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 413 XP 102,400 One minute after living creatures enter the trapped room, they are bombarded with energy that digitizes and removes their souls, leaving their bodies lifeless husks. The digitized souls are uploaded into data modules linked to the room’s computer system. Hacking the system via a successful Computers check can release trapped souls, but it usually has a wipe module—a failed attempt might purge the souls. Casting raise dead on an affected body requires a successful DC 32 caster level check or the spell fails. Soul Upload TrapType hybrid; Perception DC 45; Disable Computers DC 45 (disrupt system’s upload capacity) or Mysticism DC 40 (scramble magic) Trigger location; Reset immediate Effect death, soul uploaded into data module; Will DC 24 negates; onset delay (1 minute); multiple targets (all targets in room)?
