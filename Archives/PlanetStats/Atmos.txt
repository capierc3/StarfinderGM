Cold
Does cold and frost damage
per second. Higher Apr increases this damage
Corrosive
Does APR amount of acid type
damage per 60 earth seconds.
Combustive
Any ignition, spark or open flame has a chance
to do fire + explosion
damage. The higher the APR, the greater the
chance of this occurring and the worse the
explosion/fire when it does.
Greenhouse
This type is very hot and oppressive. This does
AR in heat damage per second. Pressure
damage based effects are doubled. Metal and
stone can melt at the extremes. A Classic
example of this type is Venus.
Inert
Although breathable by most races (racial
differences not included), too much expose
can cause “Inert Gas Narcosis”
Symptoms include Light-headedness, reduced
dexterity, euphoria, and impaired judgment.
Each second of exposure to this atmosphere
type has a chance equal to AR/10
of this occurring.
Standard/Earth-Like
This is the same as Earth, same
problems as well as same
benefits.
Suffocating
Breathing is virtually impossible here
for anything not adapted to
this atmosphere. The higher the APR, the
quicker your body would think you are being
suffocated.
Toxic
Each APR point represents how much
poison-like damage is done to anyone who
breathes this atmosphere and is not adapted
to it.
Volcanic
Each AR point represents an
active volcano. The atmosphere is also slightly
corrosive. This is similar to a Corrosive
atmosphere but divided the rating by 10
